# About
This project was used to interface my Quantum Annealing Algorithm with the DWave API
The algorithm solves the Traveling Salesman Problem which is inputted as a matrix to the algorithm 

The project was my submission for ISEF 23' and an improved version was submitted to JSHS 24'
# Traveling Salesman Problem
The Taveling Salesman Problem asks" Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" and is a classic example of an NP hard problem.

## Usage

A simple command that runs your program. For example,

```bash
python <demo_name>.py
```

If your example requires user input, make sure to specify any input limitations.

## Code Overview

A general overview of how the code works.

We prefer descriptions in bite-sized bullet points:

* Here's an example bullet point

## Code Specifics

Notable parts of the code implementation.

This is the place to:

* Highlight a part of the code implementation
* Talk about unusual or potentially difficult parts of the code
* Explain a code decision
* Explain how parameters were tuned

Note: there is no need to repeat everything that is already well-documented in
the code.
